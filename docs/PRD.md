# PRD: Creating a Calendar-Journaling-Todo App, Codenamed Calmemaybe

## Why I Create This

I create this project mostly for myself. I'm not the most irresponsible person that I know, but also I'm not necessarily as organized as I like to be. I want to try a new way to get my life... um... more organized. It's not becuase I want to be a productivity geek who feels like every second of my waking hours must be spent productively. But I do want to feel fulfilled in how I spend my time. I want to be able to look back and say to myself, "that was time well spent, that was life well lived". What a dreamer I am. I know. Haha.

The core idea of this app is I want to convert what I deem as my current "ideal" flow from a string of manual works accross different products (spreadsheet, Gmail, Google Calendar, Obsidian, and Slack) into one app that can sync to those products automatically.

In addition to that core need, this is also a personal project for me to hone my "frontend" skills. While I have learned some frontend tech stack during my university days some twenty years ago, in my fifteen years career I mostly work in backend and infrastructure related area. Therefore, I want to use this project as a way to have a tangible result from my journey in learning frontend stack. Ideally this app will be a cross-platform app, available as both web and mobile app, but I'll start with the web app first.

While I will approach this project in a "build in public" manner, I will do what I call "publish, but not publicize". So, this repository is public for everyone to see, but I will not make too much fuss about it anywhere until I think I have something worthwhile to share. But since this is a public git repository, everyone can always look at this and see the history of its git commits to see how this project evolved over the time. As of now, I don't care much if this is useful to others, but I sure hope this is at least useful for me.

## What is Calmemaybe?

Calmemaybe is a hybrid of calendar, journaling, and to-do list app. I just find it amusing to call it Calmemaybe as a spin of the song Call Me Maybe. Weird sense of humor, I know.

### The Flow

Before I can explain about the app, I have to explain what my "ideal" flow looks like:

1. Weekly schedule in Google Sheet

    I usually start with a spreadsheet of what my typical weekly schedule will look like. It looks something like the following table.

    | Time  |       | Monday     | Tuesday |
    |-------|-------|------------|---------|
    | 09:00 | 09:30 | Focus time | 1:1     |
    | 09:30 | 10:00 | Focus time | 1:1     |
    | 10:00 | 10:30 | Standup    | Standup |

    I find having this weekly schedule to be helpful for myself as it gives me something visual that I can look at to prepare my mental model to face the days. Of course the above is just an example, my actual spreadsheet contains a 24-hours table, broken down into 30 minutes.

    Afterward, before any given week, I like to fill in with the actual details of the week such as the one seen in the following table.

    | Time  |       | Monday            | Tuesday    |
    |-------|-------|-------------------|------------|
    | 09:00 | 09:30 | PRD for Project X | 1:1 with Y |
    | 09:30 | 10:00 | PRD for Project X | 1:1 with Z |
    | 10:00 | 10:30 | Standup           | Standup    |

    As illustrated above, the actual details of time slots like "Focus time" and "1:1" can vary. One week I work on PRD for some project in Monday morning focus time slot, another week I might work on some Google Slide presentation for an upcoming MBR. Well, you get the idea.
